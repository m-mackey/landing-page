# landing-page

ðŸš§ In progress ðŸš§

Landing page project from [the Odin Project lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

Showcases HTML/CSS skills, as well as ability to build a webpage based on an image and a few given details.

While I am already familiar with HTML and CSS, my goal with this project is to exercise and strengthen that knowledge. One challenge I am giving myself is to *only* use CSS flexbox for layout; in the past I have mostly relied on grid first with flexbox use as needed. The challenge doesn't call for it, but I am making the page responsive as well.
